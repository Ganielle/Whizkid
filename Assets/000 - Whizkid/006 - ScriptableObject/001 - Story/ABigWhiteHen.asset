  <Title>k__BackingField: A BIG WHITE HEN
  <Content>k__BackingField: There was once a big, white hen that had twelve little
    chicks. The chicks were very small, and the old hen took good care of them. The
    chicks always did what the hen told them to do. One day, the old hen took her
    chicks down to a small brook. It was very pretty on the other side of the brook,
    and the hen wanted to take her chicks over there. There was a large stone in
    the brook. The hen thought her chicks were big enough to jump onto that stone.
    Then they could jump from the stone to the other side. So, the hen jumped onto
    the stone and told the chicks to come after her. For the first time, the chicks
    would not obey her.
