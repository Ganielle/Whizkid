  <Title>k__BackingField: LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD
  <Content>k__BackingField: Once upon a time there was a sweet little girl. Everyone
    who saw her liked her, but most of all her grandmother, who did not know what
    to give the child next. Once she gave her a little hood made of red velvet. Because
    it suited her so well, and she wanted to wear it all the time, she came to be
    known as Little Red Riding Hood. One day her mother said to her, "Come Little
    Red Riding Hood. Here is a piece of cake. Take it to your grandmother. She is
    sick and weak, and it will do her well. Mind your manners and give her my greetings.
    Behave yourself on the way, and do not leave the path, or you might fall down
    and drop the cake, and then there will be nothing for your sick grandmother"
